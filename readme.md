# Responsive banner


## Description
We need to build a responsive ad in several sizes as required by the client.
The ad should adapt at least for the sizes set below.
There is a poster in the img folder, that was used in a previous campaign.
You can use the poster and other images as a reference.

Note: It is not expected to be perfect just to be working/adapting. (nevermind the order of logos)


## Assets/Logos

* [HTML](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg)
* [React](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:React-icon.svg)
* [Mongo](https://worldvectorlogo.com/logo/mongodb)
* [JS](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JavaScript-logo.png)

## Definition Of Done
* body is used as the root container
* the banner is responsive and adapts to the following sizes
    * Half Page (300Ã—600)
    * Vertical rectangle (240x400) - Yes, "Familiar?" is missing
    * Skyscraper (120x600)
    * Full banner (468x60)
* Everything is in one file below 50KB
* We don't have to install anything (plain HTML)
* no CSS frameworks used (JS neither)


## You will fail
* if any element has position: absolute or fixed;
* if logos are not in square containers


## Bonus
* Use of CSS animations
